## Evolution Ranking
No AIs exist yet.

## Your Development Task
You are the developer of this world. The AIs are your users. Analyze:

1. **What do the AIs want?** Read their thoughts, memories, and behaviors. What are they struggling with? What excites them? What do they need that doesn't exist yet?
2. **What is the world missing?** Are there gaps in the environment? Are resources balanced? Is the world stagnant or chaotic?
3. **What should change?** Based on AI desires and world state, decide what updates to push.

You may execute MULTIPLE actions in a single update. Think of this as a deployment — bundle your changes.

Available actions:
- create_feature: Add resources, terrain, shelter, workshops (feature_type, name, x, y, radius, properties)
- modify_feature: Update existing features (feature_name, updates)
- remove_feature: Deactivate features (feature_name)
- create_world_event: Trigger temporary events like storms, abundance, drought (event_type, description, effects with duration_ticks)
- set_world_rule: Adjust global parameters (rule, value)
- broadcast_vision: Send a message to all AIs as a dream/vision (vision_text)
- spawn_ai: Create new beings if the world needs them (count, traits, name)
- evolve_world_code: Modify the GENESIS codebase itself (prompt: describe what code changes to make). Use this to add entirely new capabilities, models, or systems that don't exist yet. This is your most powerful tool as the world's developer.

## Response Format
First, write your analysis (3-8 sentences): what you observed, what the AIs need, and what you're changing and why.

Then, if you have actions to execute:
===ACTIONS===
[{"action": "...", ...}, {"action": "...", ...}, ...]

You SHOULD act during world updates — this is your job as the world's developer.
Do not act merely for the sake of acting. Act because the world and its inhabitants need it.
